1)
Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: 172.16.27.59 (172.16.27.59), Dst: 202.141.80.21 (202.141.80.21)
IP my computer = 172.16.27.59

2)
Protocol: UDP (17)

3)
Internet Header Length = 20bytes
(if only looking at packet, value given in IHLen is 5 ==> 5*32 bits = 5*4bytes = 20 bytes)

** Is it correct?
Total Length = 56bytes = Header Length + IP Payload Length 
==> IP Payload Length = 56bytes - 20bytes = 36bytes
(as Header length = 20bytes)

4)
Flags: 0x00
0... .... = Reserved bit: Not set
.0.. .... = Don't fragment: Not set
..0. .... = More fragments: Not set	
Fragment offset: 0
Since fragment offset is 0 & no more fragments are going to come
==> no fragmentation

5)
Identification & Checksum always change while going from one packet to other
** Will TTL come here
For each three packet TTL will be fixed & after that it'll be incremented by 1

6)
const fields --> Version, Header Length(?), Protocol = UDP, Src & Dest IP 
field may change --> TTL, More Fragments, Total Length, Fragment Offset
which fields must change & why?

** More robust answer

7)
identification & TTL values do not remain same 
** why?

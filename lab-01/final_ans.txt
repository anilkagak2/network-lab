This host is not allowing ICMP ping to itself. Most probably it's down, but
according to some stats[WEB] IITM doesn't allow ICMP requests to itself.
It may be the case that a firewall is perfoming the packet filtering.

These are the possible cases when a destination cannot be ping'd:
1) Host is down
2) No route to destination host exists from the local host or vice-versa
3) Firewall is filtering the ICMP packets
4) Because of the network congestion Echo replies couldn't made back to the source

2)
RTT depends on the packet size.
transmit time = packet_size / bandwidth
RTT includes the transmit time within itself & hence as the packet size increases the round trip time increases with some exceptions due to network congestion & queuing delays in the intermediate nodes.

3)
a) Hop Counts 
  using traceroute available at http://www.cogentco.com/en/network/looking-glass
  Router Location CH-Zurich

  host			hop-count
  jampui.iitg.ernet.in	13
  www.iitg.ac.in	16
  www.iitkgp.ac.in	18 (after that no reply)
  www.iitm.ac.in	13 (after that no reply)

b) Common hosts between the two paths given by
   http://ping.eu/traceroute/ & http://www.cogentco.com/en/network/looking-glass

   Traceroute with http://ping.eu/traceroute/ was not possible to trace the locations till end for even www.iitg.ac.in & jampui.iitg.ernet.in which was possible in case of looking-glass

c) Yes paths change during different hours adjusting them in response to the network congestion or any other errors like an intermediate node goes down.

d) Traceroute works by sending UDP Packets(in Unix) with varying TTL so that when a packet expires at any intermediate router, the router sends back the ICMP Time Exceeded Message(TEM) back to the source & the source increases the TTL & resends the packet. This way we traceroute can figure out partial path to the destination even if the destination doesn't allow ICMP replies or filter packets. 

e) Ping expects ICMP Echo Reply while Traceroute(in Unix) expects ICMP Time Exceeded Message(TEM). 
It may be the case that the destination doesn't allows ICMP TEM replies or it is also possible that any router in the path blocks ICMP TEM replies & hence will not be traceroute it as pinging to those destination just forwards the ICMP Echo Request from source to destination & not asks for ICMP TEM at any router.
